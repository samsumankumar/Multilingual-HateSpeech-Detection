We have implemented monolingual hate speech detection, on a low resource setting using mBERT on 3 different languanges (Arabic, English, French).
For the low resource setting we've trained on languages with a size of 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and len(data).
The source code is in source folder and the the output for the same are also uploaded.
